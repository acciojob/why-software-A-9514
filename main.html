	<h1>"Why I want to become a developer?"</h1>
	<p>An important part of being a software developer is continuing your education. There are always new tools to acquire and better ways of developing software. Software developers need to spend a considerable amount of time keeping up to date with the latest news and developments in their industry so that they can create the best possible products.
If you're someone who likes to learn new things, software development can be a rewarding field. I'll learn new programming languages, new ways to use old languages and new tools to make development easier. In addition, I'll be able to learn new things about the industry you are working in.</p>
